## TLDR
This paper develops methods to ensure the safety of teleoperated robots with stochastic latency. To do so, we use tools from formal verification to construct a shield (i.e.,run-time monitor) that provides a list of safe actions for any delayed sensory observation, given the expected and worst-case network latency.
